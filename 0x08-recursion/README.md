Project: 0x08. C - Recursion
This project focuses on implementing various functions using recursion in the C programming language. Each function performs a specific task related to recursion and helps deepen the understanding of recursive algorithms.

Files Description:
main.h: This header file contains function prototypes for all the functions implemented in the project.

_putchar.c: This file contains the implementation of the _putchar function, which writes a character to the standard output.

0-puts_recursion.c: This file contains the implementation of the _puts_recursion function, which prints a string using recursion.

1-print_rev_recursion.c: This file contains the implementation of the _print_rev_recursion function, which prints a string in reverse using recursion.

2-strlen_recursion.c: This file contains the implementation of the _strlen_recursion function, which calculates the length of a string using recursion.

3-factorial.c: This file contains the implementation of the factorial function, which calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

4-pow_recursion.c: This file contains the implementation of the _pow_recursion function, which calculates the value of a number raised to a power using recursion.

5-sqrt_recursion.c: This file contains the implementation of the _sqrt_recursion function, which calculates the natural square root of a number using recursion.

6-is_prime_number.c: This file contains the implementation of the is_prime_number function, which determines if a number is a prime number using recursion.

100-is_palindrome.c: This file contains the implementation of the is_palindrome function, which checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

101-wildcmp.c: This file contains the implementation of the wildcmp function, which compares two strings containing the special character * as a wildcard using recursion
