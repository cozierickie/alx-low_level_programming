0x15. C - File I/O

Overview
This project focuses on file I/O operations and system calls in the C programming language. The tasks involve creating functions that read, write, and manipulate files using system calls like open, read, write, and close. Additionally, the project includes a program that displays information from the ELF header of an ELF file.
