0x14. Binary - Bit Manipulation
Overview
This C programming project delves into bit manipulation, emphasizing binary operations. The tasks include writing functions for converting binary to an unsigned int, printing binary representations, and performing bitwise operations. Additionally, the project explores concepts related to endianness.

Key Tasks
0-binary_to_uint.c: Convert a binary number to an unsigned int.
1-print_binary.c: Print the binary representation of a number.
2-get_bit.c: Get the value of a bit at a given index.
3-set_bit.c: Set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4-clear_bit.c: Set the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5-flip_bits.c: Count the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.
100-get_endianness.c: Check the endianness of the system.
