Project: Makefiles
This project consists of implementing Makefiles to compile C programs efficiently and manage the project's build process. Makefiles are essential for automating the compilation process, managing dependencies, and ensuring that only the necessary files are recompiled when changes are made.

Project Description
In this project, we create Makefiles to compile C programs with specific rules, variables, and functionalities. Each Makefile is designed to fulfill certain requirements and build the executable efficiently.

Project Files
The project files include:

0-Makefile: Makefile for Task 0.
1-Makefile: Makefile for Task 1.
2-Makefile: Makefile for Task 2.
3-Makefile: Makefile for Task 3.
4-Makefile: Makefile for Task 4.
5-island_perimeter.py: Python script for Task 5.
5-main.py: Main script to test Task 5.
README.md: Project README file.
Tasks
Task 0
Create the first Makefile with basic functionality to compile C programs.

Task 1
Enhance the Makefile by adding variables CC and SRC to customize the compiler and source files.

Task 2
Develop a more useful Makefile with additional variables OBJ and NAME to manage object files and executable name.

Task 3
Improve the Makefile with additional rules (clean, oclean, fclean, re) to clean and recompile the project efficiently.

Task 4
Create a complete Makefile with additional compiler flags (CFLAGS) for better error checking and warning management.

Island Perimeter
Task 5 involves implementing a Python function island_perimeter(grid) to calculate the perimeter of an island described in a grid.
