0x10. C - Variadic Functions
In this project, we will explore variadic functions in C. Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. We will use the <stdarg.h> header and the macros va_start, va_arg, and va_end to handle the variable arguments. Additionally, we will learn about the const type qualifier, its usage, and its benefits.
