Task 0: Object-like Macro
Create a header file that defines a macro named "SIZE" with a value of 1024. This macro can be used as an abbreviation or replacement for the token 1024 throughout your code.

Task 1: Pi
Create a header file that defines a macro named "PI" with a value of 3.14159265359. This macro can be used as an abbreviation or replacement for the token 3.14159265359, representing the mathematical constant Pi.

Task 2: File Name
Write a program that prints the name of the file from which it was compiled. This can be achieved using the FILE macro, which expands to a string literal containing the current source file name. After printing the file name, output a new line.

Task 3: Function-like Macro
Write a function-like macro named "ABS(x)" that computes the absolute value of a number x. The macro should take the input parameter x and return the absolute value, which is the magnitude of x without its sign.

Task 4: SUM
Write a function-like macro named "SUM(x, y)" that computes the sum of the numbers x and y. The macro should take two input parameters, x and y, and return their sum.
