Description:
This project consists of several tasks aimed at reinforcing knowledge and skills in JavaScript related to objects, scopes, closures, and inheritance. Each task involves creating or modifying JavaScript classes, functions, and methods to achieve specific objectives outlined in the task descriptions.

Project Structure:

Task Files: Each task is represented by a JavaScript file named according to the task number (e.g., 0-rectangle.js, 1-rectangle.js, etc.).
Main Files: Files named 0-main.js to 13-main.js serve as entry points for testing the functionality of the implemented classes and functions.
Supporting Files: Additional files such as README.md, 100-data.js, and 101-data.js provide necessary information, data, or context for completing certain tasks.
Tasks Overview:

Rectangle #0: Define an empty Rectangle class using the class notation.
Rectangle #1: Define a Rectangle class with width and height attributes initialized in the constructor.
Rectangle #2: Modify Rectangle class constructor to handle cases where width or height is 0 or negative.
Rectangle #3: Add a method to Rectangle class to print the rectangle using the character 'X'.
Rectangle #4: Add methods to Rectangle class to rotate and double the dimensions of the rectangle.
Square #0: Create a Square class that inherits from Rectangle class, implementing a square with equal width and height.
Square #1: Add a method to Square class to print the square using a specified character, defaulting to 'X'.
Occurrences: Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a given element in a list.
Esrever: Implement a function to reverse a list without using the built-in reverse method.
Log me: Create a function to log the number of arguments printed and their values.
Number conversion: Develop a function to convert a number from base 10 to another base.
Factor index: Create a script to compute a new array based on the index of elements in an imported array.
Sorted occurrences: Write a script to transform a dictionary of occurrences by user ID into a dictionary of user IDs by occurrence count.
Concat files: Build a script to concatenate content from two source files into a destination file.
Instructions for Execution:

Ensure Node.js version 14.x is installed.
Install semistandard package globally for code compliance: $ sudo npm install semistandard --global.
Execute individual task files using Node.js: $ node 0-main.js
